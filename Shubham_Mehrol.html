      When is the best time to start preparing for the Placement season? What are the steps to get started with it?
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    Well, its always good to start as soon as possible but usually people are involved in
    their internships before the start of their placement season, so the ideal time to
    get started is when you start making your CVs i.e., usually is mid-august or
    September. Main steps to get started is to find appropriate material for practice
    (textbooks or digital content), make a job group (VV Important) and start believing
    in yourself that I am going to get the best job.

    What were the major problems that you faced during your interview and test preparation?
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    Well, if you do the above-mentioned things right, there will not be many problems
    that you will face and specifically talking about myself – I didn’t face any major
    problem. Some people might start to feel a little anxious in the start thinking about
    how things will come out and when people perform better in tests and everything.
    One thing that you have to remember always is that if you’ve decided that you
    want to get a good job and you’re preparing for it honestly; nothing can stop you
    from getting it. Just stay positive and keep working hard. Also, people may face
    
    problem juggling with their academics and preparation. I’ll suggest that do a
    smaller number of courses in your job sem. 4 is a decent number.

    What were the major similarities and differences between your intern and placement interviews?
 </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    I guess there are only similarities with almost no or very less differences. In intern
    also most companies take interviews seriously and rigorously as most companies
    want to give PPO’s to their interns because nobody wants to let go of good talent.
    Intern is also you can say a job for 2 months, so I don’t think there are any
    differences in terms of the hiring strategy.

    Which one do you prefer, online or offline placements? What are your views about the same?
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    Well, I’ve only experienced online placements but I guess nothing has changed
    much, it was only that we had to give interviews via our laptops and all. We still
    gave tests which we used to do earlier; enough proctoring tools are there to
    prevent any malpractices. So, I guess both are okay but also, I would say that
    interviews are actually a situation where you try to sell yourself (not literally) and I
    think a person can present himself or herself better in a physical situation rather
    than a virtual one so yeah, Final take – Offline is better.

    How did you decide your field of interest? Should a student have a backup with themself? 
 </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    Well, I was always a little bit more inclined toward the economic and business side
    of things, in my 11th standard also where people usually take Physical Education or
    Computer Science as their 5th subject, I took Economics. In my first 2 years of
    college, I was clear that I did not wanted to go into pure sciences or engineering.
    Well, I have a good technical aptitude but figured out that I can put it to best use
    being a management of business executive given my interest and inclination and
    my appropriate social nature. Being an engineer, problem solving is in our blood
    and that is what exactly consultants and product managers do – identify the
    problems and loopholes in a business and then try to solve or get rid of them or
    identifying new avenues to go into to help provide a much-needed service to the
    people. I was passionate about this and so finally decided to aim for the Product
    Management Jobs in the companies on campus.
    
    I personally do not think that you should have a backup because that only distracts
    you from giving your 100% toward your primary goal. People then start to get
    confused between their primary goal and backup goal, which one is better etc etc
    which should not happen. Give adequate though in deciding what you want to do
    and then go bang on!!!

    What are the necessities for targeting the field you are in? Any courses or skills? 
   </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    Well, if you are aiming for the management jobs in the companies coming on
    campus, I would like to give some numbers to you. Only 20-25 % of the total jobs
    are management profiles or maybe even less. Other are core jobs or software
    profiles. Well business profiles can be exciting and more fun to work in than an IT
    job, but one should keep somethings in mind which are the necessitiesfor this field.
    You should be people centric and should have good management and leadership
    skills. These are front desk jobs and require on the go smartness which comes only
    from good amount of exposure to the world and people. Extroverts usually excel
    better in these profiles than introverts. Remember you do not need very high CGPA
    but need a very high social aptitude.
    Specifically talking about product management, it is much like consulting but in a
    better way as it exposes you to all sides of a business, whether it be marketing,
    operations, branding, finance, product development etc which altogether makes it
    much more interesting.
    So final take – focus more on your personal development rather than only
    academics, it will make you a better person in the long run and most probably will
    land you a decent job.
    Talking about courses, if you really want to gain some extra knowledge you can do
    some MSL courses.

    Is there anything unique or something regretful that you did in this placement season? Any advice for the juniors about the same?
</h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    One thing I did was applying in some random companies for profiles in which I did
    not wanted to go just for the sake of applying and because of peer pressure. I will
    tell you; it only wastes your time. You then must take part in the process, give
    unnecessary tests and all even when you do not actually want to land a job in that
    company. Also, if by chance you get an interview call, you will get tensed because
    you have not actually prepared for the profile and there are high chances that the
    interview will not go well which will not be very good for your confidence.
    
    So only apply in companies and for profiles in which you really want to go and can
    imagine yourself working. Use your applications wisely and appropriately. Do not
    bulk apply.

    Some of the students wish to pursue further studies. Do the higher studies
    application timeline and placement session go along easily or is there
    something to keep in mind?
 </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    I do not specifically know about the higher studies application process so maybe
    not the best person to answer this question.

    If someone does not get an intern via OCS in their 3rd year, what should they
    do? How does it affect their placement chances?
</h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    Well, internships are definitely very important but what companies see in your
    resume is that whether you have used your 3 or 4 years of your college life wisely
    or not. Your CV should reflect that you have been involved in something or the
    another throughout your college life and not spent your college life sitting in your
    hostel room. So, keep yourself involved in one thing or the other. And if specifically
    talking about the 3rd year internship, try to get an internship off campus or you can
    also get yourself enrolled in some virtual internships programmes. Moral of the
    story is that If an interviewer asks you what you did in any summer or any semester
    – you should have a genuine answer.

    Final word from your side? (Some tips which would have wanted your senior to give you)
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    Enjoy the placement season without stressing much about it. Find your calling and
    work towards it rather than following the herd. (Also, if you are not able to find
    your calling or identify your passion, then following the herd is also not a bad
    option)
    Also keep working towards your personal development along with academics. That
    is very important not only for placements but for your life ahead.
