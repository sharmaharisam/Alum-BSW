      When is the best time to start preparing for the Placement season? What are the steps to get started with it?
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    Even if you do just one question every day, you can easily ace the coding interview
    rounds. So just start solving one question every day. I would recommend solving the
    Leetcode monthly daily challenges. For example this month's January
    LeetCoding Challenge 2021.
    You don't need any prerequisites to start. Just pick any coding website like (LeetCode,
    hackerrank, hackerearth etc...) and start solving problems.

    What were the major problems that you faced during your interview and test preparation?
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    I didn't face any problems as such. Because I practised so many questions, I was also
    able to solve the new types/ variations of the questions asked in the online/ interview
    rounds.

  <h1 class="text-4xl text-center mb-4 font-semibold font-heading font-semibold">
    What were the major similarities and differences between your intern and placement interviews?
 </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    They were absolutely the same. I could recall the same type of test pattern was also
    asked in the internship tests. I just wished I would have started solving problems much before
    so I would have been able to bag a very good internship from a great firm for my 3rd year
    summer internship as well. I am 100% sure you will be able to get selected for a great company
    no matter your branch if you perform well in the online coding tests/ interviews. </p>

    Which one do you prefer, online or offline placements? What are your views about the same?
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    Although there would not have been a huge difference in them, I liked online placements
    better. It was more comfortable. You don't have to get ready (Just putting on a shirt will do), run/
    cycle to LHC hoping you get there on time, you don't have to face your competition outside the
    interview room (I would have gotten very tense and stressed worrying about how I will be able to
    compete with them). There is no walk of shame back to your hostel after knowing you didn't get
    shortlisted for further rounds.
    Also I think it would have been much more difficult to write my code on a piece of paper. So I
    consider myself lucky I had the luxury of typing the code on my keyboard during the interview.    </p>

    How did you decide your field of interest? Should a student have a backup with themself? 
 </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    I knew I loved to code and solve coding problems from the moment I studied for the
    COL100 course. I thoroughly enjoyed completing the coding assignments and getting full
    marks for every test case. I also loved to solve the coding assignments of my friends.
    Although I would have loved to help them for free, I still told them I would complete your
    assignment only if you give me a treat in the night mess :p
    This made coding my primary field of interest.
    If you know your only field of interest, all your problems are solved. The only thing you
    need to focus on is to get better and better in that field. You know your target. You just have to
    exercise and practice on hitting the target better and better.
    Definitely you should explore every one of your options. You should start preparing for every
    role. As you go on preparing for them, you will gradually realise whether this field interests you
    or not. So you can streamline your options and eventually you will realise the field in which you
    are most interested in.
      </p>

<article class="py-12 px-4">
  <h1 class="text-4xl text-center mb-4 font-semibold font-heading font-semibold">
    What are the necessities for targeting the field you are in? Any courses or skills? 
   </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    For coding profiles, you only need to be good at solving coding problems. Nothing else.
    You don't even need to do COL106 (You don't need to do it, although it does help a lot.) or any
    other course for that.
    Just like we solved tons of Math problems for JEE, with deliberate practice we all were able to
    solve those math problems with ease. The same applies for coding problems as well. If you
    practise more and more you will become better and better.
    Just start solving just one question every day. You will realise later how far just that one question
    every day can take you. You will on your own realise and figure out what you need to do further
    down the road.

    Is there anything unique or something regretful that you did in this placement season? Any advice for the juniors about the same?
</h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    Sitting for this placement season, I came to know that the companies don't care about
    your branch at all as long as you are able to ace the tests and the interviews. Although
    some companies are biased on your branch and don't even let you apply (e.g.
    Microsoft). But there are tons of companies that are not biased and will just select the
    top performing candidates.
    After I came to know this, I just had one regret that If I had started solving coding
    problems much earlier, I would have been able to secure a great internship at a huge
    and reputable firm in my 3rd year also.
  </p>

<article class="py-12 px-4">
  <h1 class="text-4xl text-center mb-4 font-semibold font-heading font-semibold">
    Some of the students wish to pursue further studies. Do the higher studies
    application timeline and placement session go along easily or is there
    something to keep in mind?
 </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    I personally did not have any interest for further studies at all. I did NOT prepare for
    anything. I was sure the only thing I want to do after college is a job. So I only focused
    on preparing myself for the interviews.
    I can't comment further on further studies because I don't know anything about it. Asking
    someone else would be better. Many prepared for CAT, GRE etc...
    I also kind of consider myself very lucky because I did not drain my energy and effort on
    preparing for those exams. I knew what I wanted( A great job) so I only focused on that.

    If someone does not get an intern via OCS in their 3rd year, what should they
    do? How does it affect their placement chances?
</h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    I was not able to get selected during the peak time when all the best firms come to hire
    for interns around September 2019 ( In my 5th semester). But this rejection indeed
    helped me in my job placement selection!
    I was so disheartened that I was not able to get selected. Maybe because I am from
    textile. So I just had the mentality that no great company would hire me. So everytime I
    prepared for my coding interviews before the placement season, I always had this
    thought running in the back of my mind. This kept on motivating me to become better
    and better and work even harder so that I might have a mere chance of getting selected
    at those reputable firms based on my performance in the tests and interviews.
    And indeed this is what happened! I was able to crack every one of my 4 interviews with
    flying colours. I knew the approach and method to solve every question asked to me
    during the interview.
    So if you didn't get a great 3rd year intern at a huge reputable firm, No need to worry!
    Just use that as a motivation to work harder and harder and crack the best firm at your
    next shot in the placement season.

    Final word from your side? (Some tips which would have wanted your senior to give you)
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    All the words that I shared with you were indeed given to me when I was in your same
    shoes by my senior Anmol Ratn. He was from the 2016 batch of textile (I am from 2017
    batch). He was also able to secure a great job at HiLabs with a very hefty package
    (>30LPA). The only reason I was able to get selected was because of his advice.
    
    The only advice he kept on giving me was to keep working harder and harder and solve
    more and more questions. The only thing you need is to be great at solving coding
    problems. The company does not want anything else from you. He told me branch
    indeed does not matter at all. I came to realise this when I myself got selected for a job
    at a great company.
    So just keep working harder and you will soon bear the fruits of your labor. </p>
