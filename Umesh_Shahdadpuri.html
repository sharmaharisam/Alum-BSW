    What were the major problems that you faced during your interview and test preparation?
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    As I prepared for consulting firms. Due to online sem, I could not get to solve cases with other people. During offline times it is easier.  </p>

    What were the major similarities and differences between your intern and placement interviews?
 </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    <strong>Similarities</strong> – The interview process was similar, patterns were similar like there were 3-4 rounds for every company. <br>
    <strong>Differences</strong> - Shortlisting is proper in placements while in interns, many times they just shortlist on one criteria or they just shortlist on the basis of CGPA, preparation is important in placements, kind of questions were different.
          </p>

    Which one do you prefer, online or offline placements? What are your views about the same?
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    <strong>Pros for Online –</strong> You can prepare at your own pace, can chill when you want, there is no peer pressure. You don’t have to go anywhere, time wastage is reduced.
    During the interview in offline mode, they make you stay a little longer, and then you cannot attend any other interview, and many times it happens that the company rejects you and you couldn’t even attend other interviews.
    <strong>Cons for Online –</strong> Could not contact many people during the preparation, problems in solving cases as solving with a group is important.
    Interview – Connecting with the interviewer is not effective, you should focus on your communication skills more in the online mode.

    How did you decide your field of interest? Should a student have a backup with themself? 
 </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    I decided my interest by 2 things, my intern was in consulting firms. I knew about the lifestyle of graduated seniors. I am a Dual Degree student so I got enough time to think.
    Definitely, students should have a backup as the competition is increasing. It’s good to have more number of shortlists. Practice different questions for different profiles, if for consulting, prepare for analytics as well, develop some analytical skills.
      </p>

    What are the necessities for targeting the field you are in? Any courses or skills? 
   </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    First you have to decide that you have your interest in that field, you have to make up your mind, should have good communication skills. Read newspapers – Economic Times to stay updated about the Business world.

    Is there anything unique or something regretful that you did in this placement season? Any advice for the juniors about the same?
</h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    As such I am not having regrets but the advice I want to give is that students should keep a backup for themselves, shoould take up some programming projects to have some background in coding. Students should work on their analytical skills. It’s good to have a coding or Analytics backup.

    How was your placement experience like, as in the day you had interviews? Would you have preferred offline interviews?   </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    It was a pretty short experience and I would say smooth as well. My first preference was BCG. I had 2 interviews 30 min each and I was pretty much done
 
    I feel the online mode worked out well for me, I was less stressed as the interviewer was not right next to me. The offline mode also limits your access physically since you need to move around a lot from one floor to another, which might have stressed me out. So, I think I prefer online over offline but this is just my hindsight speaking which shouldn't be a reliable voice.

    If someone does not get an intern via OCS in their 3rd year, what should they do? How does it affect their placement chances?
</h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    Interns play a very important role in OCS in consulting firms, so if you are not doing an intern in pre-final year then your placements will definitely get affected, Even if you are not getting an intern through OCS, you should try applying off-campus to get into as good company as possible. Even if you are not getting that, you can work in some reputed startup but don’t go without intern.

    Final word from your side? (Some tips which would have wanted your senior to give you)
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    For consultancy, you have to work on your overall development, work on your communication skills. You should read newspaper daily in order to get to know about things happening in day to day world. Work on your analytical skills to have a backup and also it will come handy in your future.
