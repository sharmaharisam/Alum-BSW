    How did your internship at Quadeye help to decide the roles you wanted to go for in placements?  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    My 2 month Quadeye internship was shortened to 1 month. The work was generally coding and creating models. I didn’t want to go for a job that is tech-heavy so my first priority was consulting roles. Also, I knew that consulting is quite uncertain. This year, top consulting firms took not more than 16-20 ppl total. So for backup, I studied for quant roles.
      </p>

<article class="py-12 px-4">
  <h1 class="text-4xl text-center mb-4 font-semibold font-heading font-semibold">
    How did you go about preparing for consulting roles (Aseem’s first priority) and quant roles (Aseem’s second priority)? How did you manage time?  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    For quant - I revisited brainstellar, hackerrank, etc. and got better at coding. I also read the common books on probability like Heard On The Street and tried to finish these as early as possible so I largely get time to prepare for consulting. For CV, I showed it to a lot of ppl and kept constantly refining it. Also engaged in case practice.   

    As far as time management is concerned, I aligned my time according to the things which I can’t schedule - placement tests & presentations & case prep with seniors. Case prep sessions with friends were flexible. So, once I crossed out all unavailable times then rest of times I figured - how many cases do I need to do? Do I need to do any reading up for that? For coding, I looked into data structures I wasn’t not familiar with. For quant - I went to problems I hadn’t done, read solutions and tried to learn something from them.
    
    Towards the end of placements, I started using a calendar application on my laptop which was really helpful. And I would recommend everyone to develop this practice. Earlier, I used to write my to-do list for the day in the morning.
    </p>

  <h1 class="text-4xl text-center mb-4 font-semibold font-heading font-semibold">

    If you could repeat this entire placement preparation process, what would you do differently?
</h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    I would do more case practice. It is important to do a lot of practice so if you have any buddy sessions you are always good at that. One advice from my end - Make a notebook or sheet & write what went wrong in any case interview. Keep that list and if there is some repeating mistake then circle them and sort them out on priority basis. </p>

<article class="py-12 px-4">
  <h1 class="text-4xl text-center mb-4 font-semibold font-heading font-semibold">
    When to start case practice? Should it be from third year onwards?  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    Not at all. You don’t need to start case practice in your third year. It can be done in the job sem itself. What you should do beforehand is find a good job group who motivates you. Gel well with them and be involved with them.     </p>

<article class="py-12 px-4">
  <h1 class="text-4xl text-center mb-4 font-semibold font-heading font-semibold">
    Noted. Case practice is one thing off the list of a 3rd year student preparing for consult! If not case practice, then what preparation one should do in their third semester?  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    I am not saying one should start practicing cases only in the 7th sem. This year, with the sem being online, with no rdv, I could be very chill with courses. I took 6 courses, audited 3 of them, so got a lot of time on my hands. In usual times, you have 4 or 5 courses & labs and stuff, so in that case it makes sense to start earlier. I am not giving any hard & fast advice to not start & obviously, it won't hurt if you are well prepared.       </p>

  <h1 class="text-4xl text-center mb-4 font-semibold font-heading font-semibold">
    How to start case practice?   </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    Form job group. You would start doing cases with them. Reach out to seniors, you can ask them to give you standard cases from books. You can also reach out to seniors who are not sitting for placements and ask them to introduce you to standard cases. I have a friend who is a 5 year student, I did 3 or 4 cases with him, he was approachable & gave good feedback. Basically start with standard books such as case interviews cracked and case in point (not so good) etc.    </p>

    What were your main sources of stress during placement preparations?</h1>
  <p class="text-center">

    They sure are stressful. You have seniors who tell you your first job doesn’t matter much, which is great advice, but still in the heat of the moment you end up taking a lot of stress. Best thing to do is try to take your mind off things. I played football, tennis, watched movies, basically indulged myself in my hobbies. So this helped. Also, one shouldn’t try to compare themselves to others, that’s a source of stress as well. 
    Deciding preference was another source of stress. Preference determines interview time and you have to set your priorities straight and make certain tradeoffs.
      </p>
</article>

<article class="py-12 px-4">
  <h1 class="text-4xl text-center mb-4 font-semibold font-heading font-semibold">
    So, how to fill preferences? What’s your advice here?
</h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    Well, there isn’t any particular right answer. There is one particular tradeoff you need to make. You will get compelling arguments for both sides. But the tradeoff is this - in a lot of firms you get a feeling whether you will do well or not. There are things like hotlist (hotlist kind of indicates where you stand and how badly a firm wants to take you). You need to decide whether you go for a company where you are higher up on their hotlist (this is the safer option) or do you go for your number 1 company regardless of your chances. After agonizing a lot on this, I decided to put Mckinsey first as I really wanted to work there.

    As you mentioned you got quite some time to prepare owing to the semester being online, so would you say you prefer online sem over offline sem for placements?
</h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    There are certain aspects of online sem that make you worry. I was perpetually worried that my internet was going to be bad, there might be issues during interviews & other minor inconveniences. Irrespective, I would prefer online sem. In the offline sem, I would have had many more things to do & significantly less time, so I don't think I would have had a better experience in an offline sem.

  <h1 class="text-4xl text-center mb-4 font-semibold font-heading font-semibold">
    How was your placement experience like, as in the day you had interviews?  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    Well, it was pretty short. I had the 8 am Mckinsey slot. 2 rounds of interviews & got selected. TnP says companies can’t give on-spot offers but it wasn’t a problem in my case as mck told me they would be giving me the offer. After that I had to let other places where I was going to interview know that hey they shouldn’t put effort into taking my interview as I have already been selected. And this is the polite thing to do as well.

        How have your interests evolved throughout your college life? And finally, how did you zero in on consulting?      </h1>
    <p class="text-center">
        I did SURA in 2nd year summers. At one point of time, I was seriously considering research, but then decided to skip it. Then I was a quant intern at Quadeye. Work was really good but I didn’t want to work at a backend job. I wanted to work on something more impactful. Having tried so many things out it made sense to go into consulting, where I would get a chance to work across industries at higher levels.    </p>

        How were your buddy sessions? And how many buddies did you have across firms?      </h1>
    <p class="text-center">
        I think the buddy program is an amazing program. Through buddies, you get a whole lot of feedback you wouldn’t have got till now. They connect you to people to do cases with and tell you a lot about the firm. Also, they end up taking a lot of time out for you which is great. My only advice here would be to make full use of this program and get to know your buddies well. Speaking about my scenario, I had some 10 buddies from different firms and I interacted with them during a span of 1.5 months before my final interview.     </p>

        Why did you decide to skip research?
    </h1>
    <p class="text-center">

        Well, it was a personal call. First, to do research would mean spending 6 years abroad for a PhD away from home and I didn’t want to do that. Second, I wasn’t sure I was built for research in terms of the kind of things you have to do and other technicalities, which I once thought I would be interested in.

        What are the major differences between the intern and placement season?  
      </h1>
    <p class="text-center">

        Intern season is pretty short, in terms of prep also. I came to know about Quadeye a night before my interview when I googled them! Another key difference for me was making my cv. In placement season, I got my cv reviewed by many seniors. Also, in placements, the test difficulty rises quite a lot.

        If someone does not get an intern via OCS in their 3rd year, what should they do? How does it affect their placement chances?    </h1>
    <p class="text-center">


        I can tell for consulting only. From the point of view of shortlists, I would say land any intern and try to do good work. Develop a mindset to learn as much as you can. I know a lot of people who didn’t have a third year tnp intern but still managed to do very well. There is a buddy at bcg, then another friend who got a tnp intern which got cancelled. Irrespective, they did pretty amazing. As far as core jobs are concerned, I don’t think not having a 3rd year TnP intern would affect a lot as all that matters here is how good you are technically and how well can you answer questions in the tests & interviews.

        How does one gauge if they have a good cv or not for consulting?    </h1>
    <p class="text-center">

        Well, they look for good performance across your cv. They want you to have good schols, good interns, decent pors and good ecas. If you have done a lot of things in IIT you will have a lot to write. Additionally, it also depends on how you make the work you have done sound impactful. You need to spend a lot of time formatting your cv so it is more beautiful and readable. For tech/core, you wouldn’t have to focus so much on cv.       </p>

    <h1 class="text-4xl text-center mb-4 font-semibold font-heading font-semibold">
 
        What are sections one should focus on? What would your advice be here?
        </h1>
    <p class="text-center">

        Firstly, this is a bad approach. Never focus on some sections over others. Do things you enjoy, obviously try new things but not with the intention that they might end up on your cv. If you do things you enjoy and if you are good at them then you will find a lot of things to write on your cv. Don’t particularly worry about any particular section too much. I would say one thing about interns - try to do two interns, do them diligently and it will help. To tell about myself - throughout college I have always engaged myself in things I like doing, there was just one time last year when I aimed to go for convenor just so I could add it to my cv, later I backed out as my friend was contesting for it. Other than this short point in time, I never have done things from a cv perspective.    </p>

        Final word of advice for us.    </h1>
    <p class="text-center">

        Good Luck! I will just say it is important to remember that a lot of factors in this entire process are really out of your hands. It is best to not worry and it is best to not compare the kind of preparation and the amount of work you have done to other people because that is something that will stress you out. Good Luck, again. I am sure you are going to have a wonderful placement season! :)
