      When is the best time to start preparing for the Placement season? What are the steps to get started with it?
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    The best time to start for placements will be 1-1.5 months prior to the scheduled tests by OCS. Once the tests start, you won't have to do much preparation as giving 1-2 tests daily will help you in preparation.
    For tech companies give priority to Competitive Programming > Aptitude > OOPS(C++) ~ OS > Networks > DBMS > OOPS (Java). Prior to tests you can focus on competitive programming and once tests start, start studying for CS core courses in the priority order (Priority given based on the number of questions they asked in each section).
    There is a facebook page for Placements of IITs/NITs/BITs. Join that page. They float a google document which are updated by students as soon as some company takes paper in their institute. What really helps is that before any test of a particular company solve all the problems from this doc for that company. Many time company ask the exact same question and if not that they asks question based on similar concept.
    Start your placement activities with your friends in a group. Share all the information you gets (It always helps when done in a group). Set targets and discuss after each paper !
    CP :- For CP start giving contests on Codeforces and Codechef. If you are a beginner then start with the most common question which are generally asked (You can find this list on leetcode). Once you get comfortable with the this then try solving 3-4 random problems of each hard, medium and easy daily. Majority of question asked in the shortlisting round in CP are of DP(Dynamic Programming) > Trees ~ Greedy > others. So you can start by keeping this in mind (Just an insight: If 3 questions are asked then its highly probable that 2 of them use DP). Apart from this practice you can also follow GFG for algorithms. Each section of the algorithm will contain around 100-150 problems (super helpful but don't try to code all these, just think of the algorithm then check it and move on). 
    Aptitude:-  For Aptitude and puzzles solve all the problems of Brainstellar and 50 Challenging Problems(Book). If you solve these two, then it would be more than enough for most of the puzzle problems as they are of similar type only. (Puzzles are mostly asked in Interview so you can follow this in the last month also)
    OOPS:- Most of the time companies ask for OOPS in C++ only (If you have free time then you can study for OOPS in java also). For OOPS you can go to the Geek for Geeks > Tutorials > Languages > C++ and cover all the modules under the tag of OOPs, Virtual Function(very imp), Function Overloading, Operator Overloading and Dynamic Memory Allocation. Once done with all these modules you can check the MCQs of OOPS also (super helpful).
    OS :- For Operating System follow the lecture videos of Saurav Bansal (You can find these videos on YouTube) and for practice you can solve OS MCQs from geek for geeks
    Networks :- For Networks try to cover all the layers and protocols related to it. Most of the questions were from those section only. I preferred my course notes for the preparation. And for practice you can solve MCQs from GFG
    DBMS :- ER model, Relation Model, Normalization, Relational Algebra, Basic SQL queries. Most of the questions were asked from these topics. I personally preferred to follow my course notes for DBMS.

    What were the major problems that you faced during your interview and test preparation?
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    Discussion is really important after the paper. Questions get repeated again and again (even if questions are not repeated then at least the concept gets repeated). Due to everything going online it was very difficult to have a discussion after every paper. But as soon as my placement group realized this we have discussion even upto 1-2 hours after the test. It takes time to discuss the whole paper but it's worth it ! Apart from this finding the right material to study was one of the major issue. One thing that is different from interview experience is that people were not serious at that time and also the prep time also was very less but in placements everyone is so damn dedicated for it and so you can't slack off in preparation.

    What were the major similarities and differences between your intern and placement interviews?
 </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    The number of rounds were increased. The level of the question was also increased. The competition was also gets increased as during Internships people are not that much prepared but everyone is damn serious for placements.

    Which one do you prefer, online or offline placements? What are your views about the same?
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    Offline as it would have advantage of Discussion, Group Study. But there is not that harm in Online also !

    How did you decide your field of interest? Should a student have a backup with themself? 
 </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    Yeah , I think there is no harm in having a backup. Even if you get the job in the backup profile, you can always apply off campus. 
	No, I did not have a particular field in which I wanted to enter. But I definitely had some fields in mind in which I didn't want to try.

  <h1 class="text-4xl text-center mb-4 font-semibold font-heading font-semibold">
    What are the necessities for targeting the field you are in? Any courses or skills? 
   </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    That depends on the type of job. Courses and skills definitely help. But the company don't expect students to know too much about the profile they are hiring for. Thatâ€™s why they judge students based on what they should have learned in college (CP, OS, OOPS, DBMS, Networks and Aptitude).

    Is there anything unique or something regretful that you did in this placement season? Any advice for the juniors about the same?
</h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    My sleep timings were not set before the Interviews and the last day I was not able to change suddenly and was not able to get a proper sleep in the end due to anxiety. Just try to adjust your sleep timings one week before the Interviews and you will be good to go !

    Some of the students wish to pursue further studies. Do the higher studies
    application timeline and placement session go along easily or is there
    something to keep in mind?

  <p class="text-center">
    
No Idea, As I was not applying for further studies this year.

    If someone does not get an intern via OCS in their 3rd year, what should they
    do? How does it affect their placement chances?
</h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    They should try off campus and via linkedin to get an Intern. But they should then practice realy hard on their skills to get an edge over the others. Companies do care what is on your CV but only after you have cleared the short listing round and meet the CG criteria defined by the company.

    Final word from your side? (Some tips which would have wanted your senior to give you)
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    Everyone gets placed in the end so dont worry about not getting placed (even 5 pointers to those having backlogs). Just believe in yourself and don't underestimate yourself for a single second. You are in IIT Delhi, everyone around you is smart so you sometimes tend to underestimate yourself. But don't do that. You will realize this after your placements also. And also don't settle for anything less that what you think you deserve (else you will regret your decisions).
