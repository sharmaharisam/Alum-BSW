      When is the best time to start preparing for the Placement season? What are the steps to get started with it?
    </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    The whole process can be broadly divided into three parts: <br>
    1) Deciding on what you're going for in for. <br>
    2) Make a detailed itinerary of your actions to achieve your goal. <br>
    3) Implementation, you have to start acting on it. <br>
    By March-April,
    one should have a broad idea about what profiles you're applying for. I understand all of
    us don't really know about the different profiles at that time; therefore, one should
    instead focus on what skills do you wish to acquire by the time of the placement process
    So, broadly there are four different profiles one might consider from: <br>
    1) Hardcore Coding <br>
    2) Machine learning and Data Science. <br>
    3) Quant or Mapping (Web sources for preparation: Brain Steller, Gurmeet puzzles,
    50 challenging puzzles in probability) <br>
    4) Consulting <br>
    Start building a plan for yourself. Say you want to take up coding as one of the profiles,
    even if you hadn't been a coding guy your whole term, if you start by March and practice
    crazy on competitive coding sights, you can acquire that skill by October.
    For consulting, initially focus on shaping your CV. The shortlist for the interviews comes
    around the first-second week of October; keeping that in mind, one should start
    practicing Case Interviews somewhere around August.
    The placement test week would be crazy; you'll be giving two-to-three tests a day. Sating
    that, you should try and finish your syllabus BEFORE the start of the Placement tests at
    least once. During these tests, you'll only get enough time to revise the concepts; with
    this hectic schedule, you won't be able to cover anything new at that time.
    Another sweet tip for the readers would be to follow these Groups on Facebook by the
    name "IITs NITs BITs Placement." These groups contain Interview questions and Test
    questions from previous years, and many times companies repeat these questions.  </p>

  <h1 class="text-4xl text-center mb-4 font-semibold font-heading font-semibold">
    What were the major problems that you faced during your interview and tests
    preparation?    </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    I'll be answering this question for two segments: <br>
    <strong>Tests</strong> <br>
    I struggled a bit with my consistency towards these tests. You know, in the starting,
    you're all fired up! But when the going gets tough, you lose your edge a little when you
    have three tests a day for three consecutive days. It's hard to maintain your momentum.
    As I said earlier, you should be done with all your preparations at least once before the
    beginning of the Tests.
    It is imperative to be in the right headspace, as you'll be under tremendous stress during
    this time. You should consider taking up healthy habits, for instance, having a balanced
    diet or maintaining a proper sleeping schedule. These habits go a long way, I know they
    sound clich√©, but they will help you when you're under pressure. <br>
    <strong>Interviews</strong> <br>
    The interviewers leading these sessions have experience of over 20 years in the
    industry, so even if you flinch a little during the interview, they'll catch you. Therefore, it is
    essential to be in the right headspace during the process, and you've got to believe in
    yourself and your skills.
    People generally prepare for the technical round and omit the HR segment of the
    process. In my opinion, it is crucial to prepare for the HR round of the interviews.
    It all comes down to how comfortable and confident you are in your skin. You have just
    got to keep you calm during the interview and deliver up to the best of your capabilities.  </p>

    What were the major similarities and differences between your intern and placement
    interviews?
 </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    I had an off-internship season if I'm being honest. I had just returned from my semester
    abroad, and I was not-at-all prepared for the process. I was clueless, didn't really invest
    my intellect in the preparation. I didn't get any offer in the starting two days, even though
    after the end of the whole internship season, only 40/120 people from the Mechanical
    dept. got an internship through OCS; well, of course, we have to factor in the whole
    COVID situation here, too, even after considering that the number wouldn't be higher
    than 50.
    Placements are very different from internships. Not many companies visit the campus to
    hire interns, and to be frank; the internship program is not on their prime agendas either.
    For a fact, in my year, top consulting firms didn't even show up to this arrangement.
    
    I finally got an internship on the third day at Publicis Sapient. This experience made me
    realize the importance of sincerity; if only I had prepared, it would have made a
    significant difference.
    This experience helped me focus on my placements. I was fired up after this stunt, and if
    you look at my CV from the Third and the Fourth year, it is completely changed.
    Generally, people don't change it in this period, but I was motivated to do good for
    myself and put a hundred percent effort into the motion.      </p>

<article class="py-12 px-4">
  <h1 class="text-4xl text-center mb-4 font-semibold font-heading font-semibold">
    Which one do you prefer, online or offline placements? What are your views about the
    same?
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    It's not black and white between the two. I'm sort of in the grey. Both means have their
    pros and cons. For one, I wanted an offline season, and you know, to be a part of 'THE
    IITD PLACEMENTS", though the OCS did a fantastic job pulling off such a cool
    placement season in the online mode. I did miss being on campus, being with my mates,
    and getting placed together.
    Body language plays a crucial role in interviews. I did miss the distinctive look and feel of
    an interview.
    Say you're in a one-on-one interview; if you're physically present in the room with the
    mean, you can, you know, sort of sense the tone of the room, or judge the interviewer's
    body language and try and steer your interview that way.
    Imagine having a connectivity issue during your interview; it would be devastating. While
    sitting in an interview, your brain's hosting a crazy amount of thoughts and processing
    them, and above that, you're thinking about what the interviewer just asked you; among
    all these things, what if you cannot hear the voice of the interviewer, it would be the
    worst.
    Though frankly, there were a lot of advantages too that came with this mode of conduct.
    In my personal opinion, the stress level was slightly less than what an individual on the
    campus would have faced. You know-how in the campus, you're shuffling back and forth
    from your hostel to the CSC three times a day to give proctored tests. Then you get the
    results, and then there's this fierce competition, and all your peers in your friend circle in
    your hostel are competing head-to-head. Moments where your interests will collide, and
    in that moment, people won't filter what comes out of their mouths. There's this huge
    added pressure, which tops up the stress.
    During your interviews, you don't want that kind of negativity inside your head
    accompanying your thoughts. That's where I feel the Online Placements had an edge as
    all this time, I was with my family and was connected to my close friends; they are the
    best support system one could ask for. I talked to my absolute immediate niche of
    friends, friends who I know would help me and support me no matter what. I just had a
    little regret that I could not be with my friends as we all got placed. But overall, I had a
    lovely Placement season.      </p>

  <h1 class="text-4xl text-center mb-4 font-semibold font-heading font-semibold">
    How did you decide your field of interest? Should a student have a backup with
    themself?
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    Well, if you think you're clueless about what you want in your life, don't worry. You're not
    alone:)
    The best way to reach a conclusion is to explore. Explore different arenas, different
    fields and pick the one that you enjoy the most.
    Whether or not a student has a backup, well, that's a pretty tricky question to answer, to
    be honest. Well, In my opinion, it depends person-to-person. I had an internship in the
    Software Development Engineering arena in my third year in Publicis sapient, and they
    did offer me a PPO after the end of the internship. I was one of the three people there
    who had a PPO in their hand, and the rest two did accept the offer; therefore, I was
    under tremendous pressure to consider the proposal. Even though I enjoyed the term of
    my internship, I was clear in my head that coding might be something that I enjoy, and
    maybe I'm good at it, but I don't want to pursue it for the rest of my life.
    I had coding as my backup. The PPO from a reputed firm like Publicis sapient did hold
    some value. Many SDE companies did shortlist me on the first day, but I was clear that I
    had this as my backup, and Consulting was my priority. Saying that it wasn't like I didn't
    prepare for coding. I did go through a very competitive session of training for these
    companies as well.
    The thing about backups that most of you must be unaware of is that they are very
    dynamic. The shortlisting process takes place in phases; after a point of time, your
    perspective would change slightly according to the situation. By the beginning of
    November, I had around ten shortlists; they were mainly Business analysts and
    consulting firms. After this, coding as my backup career did fade away bit by bit. In my
    head, I was clear that I have ten interviews lined up, and I have prepared decently well
    to convert at least one of them into a job. Though I didn't entirely give up on my coding
    preparations, I reduced it a notch but didn't drop it altogether.
    The idea of having a backup varies from person-to-person, and it is very fluid. You
    should have backups, but these backups can change according to your position.  </p>

  <h1 class="text-4xl text-center mb-4 font-semibold font-heading font-semibold">
    What are the necessities for targeting the field you are in? Any courses or skills?
   </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    I didn't do any courses to prepare myself for the opportunity. It is a two-step process:
    You need to get shortlisted, and you have to crack the interview.
    For passing the shortlisting threshold, especially for a consulting profile, you will need a
    comprehensive, well-balanced CV. It's not necessary to have a glorious POR behind you
    to back your claim, but they do expect an all-round CV. Decent CG, good Scholiastic
    points, Extra Currics especially if you have any national-level achievements, and
    Position of Responsibilities.
    You can ramp up your CV in many ways to sway your chances towards the good. I
    bagged a one-month internship in the Winters of 2019 in IIM Ahmedabad to ramp up my
    
    CV. One could publish a paper, get a minor degree, score their way into the Semester
    merit list, or something like that to glorify your scholiastic segment. You could also
    participate in these case study competitions and grab podiums to strengthen your
    resum√©.
    The interview process is way more dynamic than the shortlisting. IITD has an excellent
    consulting culture, and you have ample resources to strengthen your preparation
    process. Given the rich culture at IIT, you'll have your seniors giving you the necessary
    'tricks'; there are also many Case Interviews solved books to help you seal the deal in
    the interview.
    To crack the interview, you'll have to prepare well in advance. You'll need good
    communication skills, along with it you should have a logical brain along with wt. Practice
    and solve lots and lots of cases.
    You should take up this habit of reading Business journals and news articles, you know,
    just to acquaint yourself with basic strategic terms in the Business world. Even if you
    don't secure a job, knowledge of the business world goes a long way.  </p>

    Is there anything unique or something regretful that you did in this placement season?
    Any advice for the juniors about the same?
 </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    I didn't have any regrets; I, fortunately, had a decent placement season. Despite the
    mistakes that I made along the way, I don't have any regrets from them; I just remember
    the learning that those mistakes taught me.
    After my four years' worth of endeavors here at IIT, I finally learned not to become too
    Outcome-Oriented in life. As IITians have this instant gratification mode 24/7, this place
    misleads into believing that every move you make has a value equal to the output it
    produced for you in the end. But the truth is, and it took me forever to figure out, that the
    real treasure is the journey, not the outcome. Try and enjoy your journey; give every shot
    your best, not just for the outcome that it may or may not produce but for the learning
    and the joy that will come doing it; even if the result is not in your favor.
    BCG was my priority, I had Flipkart's APM profile at second on my list, but the odds were
    stagged against me big time. They were to select only 10-12 presentations out of the lot
    for the next round. I gave my heart and soul to that presentation, I worked hard for it, and
    after I finished working on my ppt, I had this deep sense of satisfaction. I was
    SATISFIED with what I accomplished with that ppt, and even if the results don't go my
    way.
    "Iske bad nahi bhi hota hei na selection, toh bhi thik hei. I'm one hundred percent
    
    satisfied with the effort that I put in."
    
    I did get selected among those 12 students, but it was only because of the fact that I put
    my heart and soul into that presentation and the fact that I didn't do it for the outcome.

  <h1 class="text-4xl text-center mb-4 font-semibold font-heading font-semibold">
    If someone does not get an intern via OCS in their 3rd year, what should they do? How
    does it affect their placement chances?
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    This varies from profile-to-profile.
    For a Data Science or a Core Coding profile, your past experiences don't hold that
    significant value in hiring you. It's your skills they want. They don't really care about your
    past; it's your problem-solving skills that matter to them.
    But when it comes to profiles like Consulting, since they don't conduct any tests, as
    compared to the core coding related profiles; they do rely on your past experiences to
    judge you as an individual. An OCS internship, bagged on the first or the second day,
    does hold some value in the consideration process. These people are all IITD alumni;
    they know the process in and out; if you think you can fool them by falsely inflating your
    assets, you're wrong! The whole process of a company coming to campus, hiring interns
    from a pool of brilliant minds, and shortlisting you from the lot adds to your credibility.
    At the end of the day, that OCS internship will only be a segment of your Internship
    section in your CV. People tend to make a big deal about it, it is beneficial if you have it,
    but it's not the world's end even if you don't. Suppose you don't get a decent internship
    via OCS. In that case, you can look up other Off-campus sources, like LinkedIn, or even
    by simply dropping an email to corporations you wanna work with, or you could apply for
    an internship in Top tier universities like the London School of Business, but that is a
    tough job to cut, as to be real, you don't really have a business foundation, we are after
    all an institute of Technology, but its one of the many options.
    Remember this; these internships will only be a component in your Internship section.
    Even if you fail to bag a decent intern; there are still the other three sections on your CV
    that you can strengthen to ace the selection process

    Final word from your side? (Some tips which would have wanted your senior to give you)</h1>
      <p class="text-center">
        It is very easy to lose yourself in this rat race, as you have the best brains in the country
        competing together in the same pool. In stressful times like this, one might want to envy
        others, might doubt one's capabilities, might second guess one's decisions.
        I want to tell you, DON'T! Don't let these thoughts get the better of you. Nobody's opinion
        matters more than what you think about yourself. You have just got to trust yourself,
        have faith in your capabilities, and stay positive. What you feel about yourself matters,
        not what the rest of the world thinks.
        I'll leave my juniors with what I said to myself right before I clicked the Zoom interview for
        BCG,
        "You've got this. Just stay calm, even if you don't get this job, it's not the end of the
        world. I've faith in you and the fact that you'll accomplish something good with your life
        eventually."
        
        I just said this to myself, took a deep breath, and clicked the Zoom link.
        By 10 am, I had the offer in my hand, couldn't believe it, and things went haywire after
        that.
