      When is the best time to start preparing for the Placement season? What are the steps to get started with it?
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    Well there is no such thing as the best time but most of the people start their prep a few
    weeks after the completion of the summer internship. As most of the internships finish
    around June end or July mid so try to start your prep from August as it will give you approx 2
    month time for your preparation. By October you can expect the placement tests to start so
    starting in August will give you an ample amount of time. If you have never done competitive
    coding or do not know any particular coding language in depth I will advise you to start
    earlier.
    I started my prep by improving my competitive programming as almost every company asks
    few coding questions in their tests and even in the interview. I mainly used Leetcode for the
    practice but some of my friends also used InterviewBit so you can decide which suits you
    more. Try to revise some important courses such as Probability & Stochastic Processes and
    Datastructures & Algorithms. To practice puzzles and probability problems you can start
    with books such as "50 Problems in Probability" and "Heard on the street". Also refer to
    www.brainstellar.com which contains a good collection of frequently asked puzzles.

    What were the major problems that you faced during your interview and test preparation?
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    One of the problems which I faced was improper time management. Time management is
    crucial when you have your semester courses running in parallel to your placement
    preparation. Improper time management led to lack of time and because of it I was not able
    to finish some of the important courses such as Operating Systems and Computer Networks
    
    which cost me in some of the tests and interviews. Try to prioritize the topics according to
    their importance so that you don't miss the important stuff because of lack of time. Also
    when solving a coding problem don't jump to the solution if you are not able to solve it on the
    first try, give some thinking time and the same applies for puzzles.

    What were the major similarities and differences between your intern and placement interviews?
 </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    For me both of them differed quite a bit as for intern it was offline and for placement it was
    online. But the process was more or less similar in both intern and placement interviews i.e.
    based on your shortlists for a particular day you are assigned slots for the interviews. In
    placements no. of companies visiting on a particular day are more as compared to
    internships so time slots the given accordingly. The level of questions asked in placements
    were a little bit advanced as compared to internships. Also you should be ready to answer
    any question related to the projects and internships you are mentioning in your CV, during
    placement interviews a good amount of time is given to the discussion on your internships.

    Which one do you prefer, online or offline placements? What are your views about the same?
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    Well both of them have their pros and cons. Online placements were a less tiring process as
    compared to offline as you can just give your tests and interviews from a single place so
    commute time and energy is saved. I felt that online interviews were done more efficiently as
    all companies and students were advised to strictly stick to the given slots to avoid any
    mismanagement. But there are multiple disadvantages like during an online interview the
    interviewer can't look into your copy to see your approach to a given problem so you have to
    constantly speak during solving a problem. Apart from it internet connectivity and technical
    issues from any side could waste a lot of time during a test or interview. I personally prefer
    offline placements as it is more transparent and also an interviewer could judge you more
    properly during offline interviews.

    How did you decide your field of interest? Should a student have a backup with themself? 
 </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    There are two ways to decide which field interests you more, first is by trying it yourself and
    second is by talking to multiple seniors in different fields about their work. As I did my
    internship as a Quant Researcher I had a fair idea about the work so I talked to my seniors to
    compare different profiles on various parameters like pay, work life balance, kind of work
    etc. Do talk to the seniors and don't be afraid to ask for help as most of the time they will be
    happy to help you.
    Considering multiple factors I decided to have Quant roles on my first preference followed by
    Software and Data Science roles. I will advise you to have backup if not many companies
    visit for the profile that you are aiming for.

<article class="py-12 px-4">
  <h1 class="text-4xl text-center mb-4 font-semibold font-heading font-semibold">
    What are the necessities for targeting the field you are in? Any courses or skills? 
   </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    So if you are aiming for a Quant Researcher/ Trader role the following courses and skills will
    be helpful (* is optional)
    Courses:
    - MTL106 Probability & Stochastic Processes
    - COL106 Datastructures & Algorithms
    - MTL180 Discrete Mathematics *
    - MTL108/MTL390 Statistics *
    Skills:
    - Good at solving problems/puzzles
    - Decent competitive coding
    - Knowledge of C++ is a plus *
    Apart from these you should have a good academic record as most of the quant firms set a
    CG cutoff so try to have a CG 8+ or 8.5+ to be in a safer zone. Having good coding skills also
    help you clear the test round of software companies but in interviews they do sometimes
    ask core CS questions.  </p>

    Is there anything unique or something regretful that you did in this placement season? Any advice for the juniors about the same?
</h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    I don't remember anything regretful or unique but me and my friends created a placement
    prep group where we used to share important questions or any question which someone
    was not able to solve. We also discussed the past questions before the tests which was
    quite fruitful sometimes. Post test discussion was quite helpful as sometimes the same
    question gets repeated in multiple tests so do analyze the question which you can't solve
    during a test. Also it can help you keep track of your preparation level compared to your
    peers.

    Some of the students wish to pursue further studies. Do the higher studies
    application timeline and placement session go along easily or is there
    something to keep in mind?
 </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    I donâ€™t have much idea about the higher studies application process but from my friends'
    experience I know that managing both of them together could be tough. So try to set priority
    and manage your time properly. Do create your CV on OCS portal and apply for companies
    even if you are planning to pursue further studies as it will give you a backup in case of
    unpredictable events like COVID-19.      </p>

    If someone does not get an intern via OCS in their 3rd year, what should they
    do? How does it affect their placement chances?
</h1>
  <p class="text-center">

    Well OCS does try to bring a lot of companies for Campus Placements and Internships but if
    you don't get an intern via OCS you should start to find an off-campus intern. Although
    finding a good off-campus intern may not be easy but you should try to get a decent
    internship. LinkedIn could be helpful as many companies do post internships there and
    sometimes it also helps you to get a referral. Try to do an intern or a project during the 3rd
    year summer as recruiters do look for internships on the CV and even in interviews there
    could be a good amount of discussion on your internship work.  </p>

    Final word from your side? (Some tips which would have wanted your senior to give you)
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    Apart from all the above mentioned things stress management is a factor which is generally
    overlooked. Many people take a lot of stress and become quite anxious before a test or an
    interview which sometimes affect their performance. I too screwed some of my important
    placement tests because of it, so I will advise you to remain calm. Do not let a bad interview
    affect your performance in the other interview; keep in mind that recruiters do not expect you
    to know everything just keep your basics clear and have confidence in yourself you will
    perform good in most of the interviews.
