      When is the best time to start preparing for the Placement season? What are the steps to get started with it?
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    I believe the starting of the sixth semester is a good time to start preparing for software-based profiles/companies. Especially for students from departments other than CS/MnC/EE, this is the time where most of you can take up COL106 as an elective, which I believe is very essential for Software-based profiles

    What were the major problems that you faced during your interview and test preparation?
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    Starting with coding and then regularly solving coding problems was the toughest part. I sometimes got frustrated a lot after being stuck on some problems. Apart from that one needs to devote a considerable amount of time to prepare

    What were the major similarities and differences between your intern and placement interviews?
 </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    The level of tests if definitely higher in placement tests as compared to intern tests.
I could not sit for many internship tests as I went to forex

    Which one do you prefer, online or offline placements? What are your views about the same?
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    I think they are more or less the same. A major point to take note is the scope for cheating was quite high, but even then I believe that in placements it cheating could only get you as far as the interviews. There the interviewer can easily distinguish between a cheat and a genuine guy.
    Another point is that this time in online mode day 1 was split into two days (1.1 and 1.2) as opposed to a single day. This caused some issues in some companies w.r.t them already having hired from other IITs and thus taking fewer students from IIT Delhi.

    How did you decide your field of interest? Should a student have a backup with themself? 
 </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    I used to apply for all profiles during the internship tests, but I realised that that is not a good practice. I did not have any PORs so naturally, I decided not to apply for consulting profiles. When I started preparing for other profiles such as Supply Chain Management I realised I did not like their preparation material also (topics such as thermodynamics etc). Coding seemed like a good option and it was something I found nice.
    I would advise people against preparing for all the roles, find your comfort zone and prepare for selected roles.

    What are the necessities for targeting the field you are in? Any courses or skills? 
   </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    For software roles, the most important course would be Data Structures and Algorithms (COL106). A Probability Theory course such as MTL106 would also be very helpful. Apart from them, a Machine Learning Course (such as ELL409) could be a useful course but not at all necessary. The main focus of companies is to test your problem-solving skills.

    Is there anything unique or something regretful that you did in this placement season? Any advice for the juniors about the same?
</h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    I don’t think I did something regretful as such but I used to panic a lot when I was not getting shortlisted. It turned out I was often in the waitlist of the company and was included in the final shortlist released a day before the interview. So it all turned out well in the end.
My advice would be to remain calm and have confidence in your abilities and preparation.

    Some of the students wish to pursue further studies. Do the higher studies

    something to keep in mind?

    If someone does not get an intern via OCS in their 3rd year, what should they
    do? How does it affect their placement chances?
</h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    I would say getting an off-campus internship (or a project) would be the best option. Since I went for Forex and could not sit for internships I also opted for an off-campus internship. I would say if you put in a decent amount of hard work you would get placed, despite not having an intern via OCS.

    Final word from your side? (Some tips which would have wanted your senior to give you)
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    Start preparing as soon as possible (especially 3rd yearites), revise COL106 concepts thoroughly. Do not target a particular company and do not get disheartened by a few rejections.
