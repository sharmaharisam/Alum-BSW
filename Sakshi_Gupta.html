      When is the best time to start preparing for the Placement season? What are the steps to get started with it?
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    The test format is fairly standard. <br>
    1) For tech / SDE roles: comp coding + MCQs on OS, DB, Networks <br>
    2) For tech / analyst roles in banks: same as above, plus quant <br>
    3) For ML roles: comp coding + ML MCQs <br>
    4) Also, a lot of firms have an additional aptitude section as well (math, logical reasoning) 
    which is usually very easy. <br>
    So, how much time it will take depends on how comfortable you are with coding. If you have
    zero experience, and are not comfortable with the basics like taking input/output, string and
    array operations, loops etc. then you’ll need 4-5 months. If you’ve coded before, but don’t have
    comp coding experience in particular, 2-3 months of dedicated practice should work.
    For coding - To start, pick a language, and a platform (I suggest Leetcode if you’ve more time,
    and InterviewBit if you’re in a rush). Start with the basics, then move towards topics that are
    commonly asked - arrays, dynamic programming, graphs, stacks/queues, etc.
    Practice everyday, and try to understand how to do questions on your own.
    For quant - get clear with the basics of random variables, probability, expectation. There are
    some standard puzzles and questions on websites like brainstellar.com, CSE Blog,
    Gurmeet.net, where you can find lots of prep material.

    What were the major problems that you faced during your interview and test preparation?
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    Well, if you do the above-mentioned things right, there will not be many problems
    that you will face and specifically talking about myself – I didn’t face any major
    problem. Some people might start to feel a little anxious in the start thinking about
    how things will come out and when people perform better in tests and everything.
    One thing that you have to remember always is that if you’ve decided that you
    want to get a good job and you’re preparing for it honestly; nothing can stop you
    from getting it. Just stay positive and keep working hard. Also, people may face
    
    problem juggling with their academics and preparation. I’ll suggest that do a
    smaller number of courses in your job sem. 4 is a decent number.

    What were the major similarities and differences between your intern and placement interviews?
 </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    The overall process is identical. There’s a test, followed by a CV+test score shortlist. Interviews
    are more or less the same. Placement interviews are more rigorous for sure, and there are far
    
    more people applying than for interns - but on the other hand, the number of companies is also
    much larger.
    Prep-wise, it’s almost the same, except of course placement has a higher difficulty level.

    Which one do you prefer, online or offline placements? What are your views about the same?
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    I applied for interns offline, and placements online. Personally, I preferred the online process
    because it was much, much better organized - but I guess that’s largely because of spreading
    the “days” over a longer span. I think a larger number of companies came because of the
    convenience of the whole process being online.

    How did you decide your field of interest? Should a student have a backup with themself? 
 </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    If I’m being honest, I didn’t pick a field out of interest, but more so out of exploration. Based on
    my intern, I had some idea of what fintech is like, and wanted to work on roles more heavy on
    coding.
    It’s good to have a backup, of course, plenty of chances to switch fields later too. We’re just
    starting out, it’s okay to not be 100% sure of what we want to make a career in!

  <h1 class="text-4xl text-center mb-4 font-semibold font-heading font-semibold">
    What are the necessities for targeting the field you are in? Any courses or skills? 
   </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    It’s good to have done the popular COL106 and MTL106 courses to get a hang of the basics,
    but not really necessary because in the end, you can always learn that on your own. Skills, #1
    would be comp coding definitely, and a good hold on combinatorics/probability.  </p>

    Is there anything unique or something regretful that you did in this placement season? Any advice for the juniors about the same?
</h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    Do look at past year placement docs. The format and level of tests hardly change across years.
    It gives you an idea of what to expect so that you’re comfortable while attempting a timed,
    stressful test.
    Also, practice relevant questions and don’t get caught up in unnecessary extra stuff. There’s a
    fairly standard set of questions companies ask, easily found in placement docs / Leetcode
    Discuss / InterviewBit or GeeksForGeeks archives.
    Prep for interviews in advance, shortlists come really late, sometimes even a few hours before
    the interview.  </p>

<article class="py-12 px-4">
  <h1 class="text-4xl text-center mb-4 font-semibold font-heading font-semibold">
    Some of the students wish to pursue further studies. Do the higher studies
    application timeline and placement session go along easily or is there
    something to keep in mind?
 </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    The timelines are largely coincident, and in my personal experience, it’s difficult to do both
    things at once. It’s fairly certain that you’ll focus on one of these, and keep the other as a
    backup, so prepare in advance so that the backup can be handled easily and you can put your
    energy into the main target. You can give GRE and TOEFL early on to get them out of the way,
    and work on a rough draft of your SOP in advance.

    If someone does not get an intern via OCS in their 3rd year, what should they
    do? How does it affect their placement chances?
</h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    I don’t think it matters much. Companies are only looking for relevant skills/experience on your
    CV. It could be a non-OCS intern or project, or even an independent project.
    Identify what sector you’re interested in, and work on something related to that. For example,
    banks notice if you do something related to ML / Analytics in finance. Tech firms notice if you
    have experience with Java/C++/DB/cloud. There are tons of interesting projects within IIT itself,
    and a lot of startups and smaller companies that don’t offer interns through OCS, try working at
    something that interests you.  </p>

    Final word from your side? (Some tips which would have wanted your senior to give you)
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    <strong>Don’t worry too much.</strong> This is something I wish I had heard more often. There is a lot of
    pressure involved with placements, but don’t let it overwhelm you! Please don’t get caught up in
    the rather toxic culture of “Day 1 - Day 2” or how much salary someone gets, what’s important is
    that you gain industry-relevant skills. Plenty of time ahead to build your dream career. </p>
