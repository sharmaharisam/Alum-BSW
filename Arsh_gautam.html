      When is the best time to start preparing for the Placement season? What are the steps to get started with it?
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    If one aspires for Software Engineering work, I would advise to start coding from
    the first/second year itself. 1-2 years is sufficient time to get comfortable and
    achieve a level such that placement tests would seem easy. Moreover, this would
    also help with internships. The CS topics (OS, Networks etc.) can be done through
    the courses for CS students and for non CS students, 2-3 months is sufficient.

    What were the major problems that you faced during your interview and test preparation?
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    As such I did not face any major problems during preparation. Though the online
    semester helped me manage my time very well for preparations. I could watch the
    class any time throughout the day and thus I could be very flexible with my
    schedule.

    What were the major similarities and differences between your intern and placement interviews?
 </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    During the internship interviews, I felt that I was not prepared. Secondly, I did not
    have much idea of the nature of tests and interviews. All the tests were conducted
    within 2-3 days and there was no time to reflect on the mistakes of one test. It gave
    me enough experience which I profited from during my placement interviews.

    Which one do you prefer, online or offline placements? What are your views about the same?
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    Like I said, the online semester allowed me to have a flexible schedule. Being at
    home, the only thing I spent my time on was preparing for placements which
    would not be the case in the case of the offline semester. Although interviews were
    another story. Getting 3-4 calls simultaneously from placement coordinators for
    giving my current slot of interview at the company they are managing is a
    frustrating thing :p    </p>

    How did you decide your field of interest? Should a student have a backup with themself? 
 </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    was always interested in Mathematics. Infact having no coding experience till
    class 12th, the reason for me to choose CS was due to my interest in Mathematics and
    Logic. Thus Quant always interested me. I used to solve puzzles and challenging
    problems in my free time in college. I started serious competitive coding from my second
    year and I started loving it. As a backup, I did consider the Software Companies but
    nothing extra was to be done for that. I never considered any role outside these
    categories. Infact, I did not apply for any Data Science roles as I did not like that field
    much. I think one can have a backup but should also think about their interest as even if
    you get that job you wonâ€™t like doing it.
      </p>

<article class="py-12 px-4">
  <h1 class="text-4xl text-center mb-4 font-semibold font-heading font-semibold">
    What are the necessities for targeting the field you are in? Any courses or skills? 
   </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    For Quant roles, one should have be a good problem solver and should have a
    quantitative bent of mind. Two quant offers that I got in placements (from Graviton and
    Quadeye) had interviews focussed on solving some brain teasers and puzzles. Probability
    is also an important part of the interviews of these companies. So courses on probability
    
    and books on puzzles and brain teasers, websites like BrainStellar are great sources of
    preparation. If combined with Competitive programming skills, you would be an ideal
    candidate for these companies. Although they mostly only consider CS, MnC and in
    some cases EE students.

    Is there anything unique or something regretful that you did in this placement season? Any advice for the juniors about the same?
</h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    I worked hard for the first time after coming to college XD. So yeah this was
    unique. In general, I spent 2-3 months on preparation of coding and quant skills. I
    took less load during this semester. I would advise to keep less course load during
    your placement semester so that you can focus on placements.  </p>

    Some of the students wish to pursue further studies. Do the higher studies
    application timeline and placement session go along easily or is there
    something to keep in mind?

  <p class="text-center">
    I do not have much idea about this as I never had an intention to pursue higher
    studies.

    If someone does not get an intern via OCS in their 3rd year, what should they
    do? How does it affect their placement chances?
</h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    My case is unique. I got a quant internship during the 3rd year internship season. I
    was not very happy with the internship. Later during Co-Vid time, they made the
    internship stipend less and asked us to only do a dummy project. I did not like it
    
    and left the internship. Rather I searched on linkedin, and got an internship at a
    stealth startup. The internship was a good experience for me but was at a no-name
    company compared to my peers. Though, as I have experienced it did not had any
    impact on my placements and I got offers from at least 3 companies during
    placements including 2 of the best companies on campus. So, I would advise not
    to worry about not getting an intern (or not getting an intern according to your
    expectation) and focus on improving yourself for the placement season.  </p>

    Final word from your side? (Some tips which would have wanted your senior to give you)
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">
    1. Improve your CGPA as much as possible as it is a very important criteria. <br>
    2. Start coding as soon as possible, even if you belong to non CS branches as most
    companies across all categories conduct coding tests. <br>
    3. Have confidence in yourself, as you might face multiple setbacks during the 4 
    years of college but having self confidence will help you face all of that and as we
    all know, All's well that ends well. </p>
